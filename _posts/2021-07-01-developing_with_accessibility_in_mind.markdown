Accessibility is extremely important, but unfortunately, in many industries, including ours, I find it is often overlooked or written off. As developers, we typically focus on writing the code and moving from making one widget, to making the next widget. In that process, it's so easy to stop thinking critically about the widget itself and how everyone, and I mean everyone, might use it, or more important in some instances, might not be able to use it. Let's talk about how to get better together. 

Off the bat, here are 3 questions I think you should be asking yourself as a developer:

1) What is accessibility?
2) Why is accessibility important?
3) How can I implement accessibility in my work?

These questions truly need to be answered by yourself, but I can certainly help provide resources, and offer my opinions and thoughts as well.

What is accessibility? Well, according to W3C, "Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them." So, what does that entail? Well, areas that we should consider for developing accessible software are including, but not limited to: 

* Auditory disability
* Cognitive disability
* Neurological disability
* Physical disability
* Speech disability
* Visual disability

Beyond this list though, I think accessibility is also a mindset: it's the spirit, drive, and continued improvement as a developer and person to make things, especially software, as user friendly, usable, and enjoyable to all people.

Why is accessibility important? It might seem like a stupid question to ask yourself, but I think it's super critical. You need to dig deep into yourself from an empathetic and emotionally intelligent level to think hard about why its important to you. For me, one part of my connection to why I think web accessibility is critical comes from personal experience. I have a close friend who has suffered total hearing loss in both ears. I witnessed firsthand the frustration they experience when they try to use something that doesn't support their disability. It sucks. It's really frustrating to see them dissapointed. I want to make it better and I have the power to do that. My friend isn't the only one. Tons and tons of people experience the same thing accross the world. Now, again, you might ask yourself, but why do I need this connection? Why do I need to understand the why? Honestly, in my opinion, it's because the fight to make improvements can be challenging in a company or environment and you need to have the ability to dig deep and fight for what's important with real passion and drive.

How can I implement accessibility in my work? Overall, for me, it boils down to research, practice, and feedback. Do the research on this important subject. Learn about how you can implement accessibility in your workplace. From the web perspective, here are just a few resources you could start with:

* https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/
* https://webaim.org/intro/
* https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility
* https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html

Now, when I reference practice, I mean taking this knowledge and putting it effectively out in the world. Start adding alt tags to all of your images. Build that next React component using semantic markup. Do it! After you do it though, get feedback from your audience however you can. Bring in experts to audit your work. Push out some surveys to the target audience. Ask for feedback on your forums. Make sure what you're doing is working and continue to improve however and wherever you can!

Thanks for listening to my thoughts here. Go make the world a better, more accessible place!
