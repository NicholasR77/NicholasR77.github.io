Everyone wants to be the expert at what they do. I think it's a natural desire. However, most folks don't realize that isn't the most important thing in life or your career. Developers are no different. I see people ask me how I got the job I currently have and I think most folks expect me to answer that I spent 20 hours a day coding or that I'm wicked smart. Spoiler alert: I don't and I'm not. Here are 4 things I think made me stand out for my job and might make you stand out in your current role or next role.

1 - Empathy. Learn to connect with your fellow humans on earth. Love your users. Care about your coworkers. Build that connection. It will help you be a better person and it will make you build better software. 

2 - The absolute hunger to learn everything, not just programming. Sure, building your programming skills are important, but do you know what's also super important? Writing documentation, coming up with test cases, communication, leadership, and so much more. Are you supposed to build a widget for the accounting department? Spend a day studying accounting, talk to some of the accountants, sit in on one of their meetings. Gain that knowledge!

3 - Questioning why with respect and civility. A lot of companies have folks that just say do a thing because their boss said it, or because it was done that way in the past, or because no one wants to say no. Be that squeaky wheel. Question the situation. Bring healthy conflict to the table. This world needs it badly! 

4 - Passion. Find something you truly want to do and do projects you can brag about for 30 mins without skipping a beat. I see developers sometimes make a widget that just meets the absolute minimum of what's requested. Why? They don't care about it. They just want to finish it. Find that company or project where you (healthily) obsess over making that widget. You put your heart and soul into it. You deliver above and beyond what's expected for that widget. You are devastated when bad feedback comes in, but you get back on your feet to make it better and better. You go into that every day of work knowing, even if you have a bad day, you'll have a great day soon because you love what you do.
